# Text-based Combat Game
Players fight enemies to gain experience and obtain stronger weapons, abilities, and potions to defeat progressively more difficult enemies. The goal is to survive for as long as possible by strengthening one's character. (The player's data unfortunately doesn't persist as is, though it is something for me to do.)
